              <p className="about-p">Hi, I am Julianne! I'm an undergraduate student pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science and a minor in 
              digital media, with a projected graduation date of May 2025. I am an aspiring software engineer, my most 
              experienced languages being Java and JavaScript. I have the most experience with front-end development, but 
              I enjoy working and honing my skills in full-stack development.</p>
              
              <p className="about-p">At age 12, I was introduced to my first set of code. Although I found myself wanting to pursue other things 
                during summer as a child, I am forever grateful to my parents for instilling the love for STEM in me. I am 
                proud to say that I truly enjoy computer science and software development and I strive to gain more knowledge in 
                my field each day.</p> 
                
              <p className="about-p">I also enjoy more creative avenues, such as digital media and design. I realized that I was unable to focus on 
                front-end development in my computer science courses and decided to minor in digital media to pursue my other 
                interests. I love being able to add a creative touch to the work I do.</p>
                
              <p className="about-p">As an aspiring software engineer who loves to learn and grow, I am thrilled to explore new opportunities and 
                connect with those around me.</p>
